------------------------------------------------------------------------Sucicide Ant

A scenario where the prey (small red ant) seems to want to be captured by the larger ant.

Basic task
By altering the lines in the prey class (only these lines) and by the use of a Finite State Machine
    //change this
    private int w[]={3,1,1,4,1,2,2,5};

Increase the average counter final value for 20 runs be over 
The Predator tracks the prey by decreasing the distance between the two.


Intermediate
Alter the task so that multiple prey can be hunted. Predator and prey classes can be altered by the prey must still be controlled by private int w[]={3,1,1,4,1,2,2,5};


Advanced
Genetic algorithms or similar techniques to be used alter the values in int w[]; so the system finds the values for w[], the success of the solutions (Score: ) must also be tracked.
